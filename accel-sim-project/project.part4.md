# GPU Simulation Assignment Part #4 (Bonus)

## Improving the prefetcher

In this part of the assignment, you will implement the prefetcher from the
paper in part 3 and attempt to get it to work with all the applications
in ece695.part4. You are also free to make modifications to the prefetcher
based on other prefetching papers you have read or a completely novel idea
of your own invention.

## What to hand in

Submit a 3-page maximum pdf that includes the data plots that prove your pretecher works across
all the apps or at least a subset of them.
Be sure to include paragraphs that describe what you implemented
and explain the data and the reasons why it looks the way it does.
